This React restaurant website is a project created to showcase and practice my skills in React.js. The website features a homepage displaying information about the restaurant, including its location, hours of operation, and menu items. Users can also view the restaurant's menu, make reservations, and contact the restaurant through the website. The website has been built using React, and other technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is responsive and optimized for all screen sizes. Feel free to explore and let me know any feedback or suggestions.
